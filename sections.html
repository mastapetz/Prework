        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Lions are mainly found in Africa but can also be seen in India and
          parts of Asia. They like the hot places like the Sahara in Africa and
          the dryer regions.

        <h1>Appearance</h1>
        <p>
          African lions are the lion you see most often. All lions look very
          similar but they've evolved to adapt to their home lands. The Asian
          lion is a good example. They have gold fur and a gold mane unlike the
          African lion. This is because of the rich dirt in Asia.
